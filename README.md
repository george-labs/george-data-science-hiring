Congratulations! You've advanced to our next recruiting stage, which is divided into three phases:

1. Theoretical Assessment (1 hour): This phase involves a deep dive into fundamental concepts to evaluate your knowledge and problem-solving skills.
2. Practical Task (1 hour): This is a hands-on coding or implementation exercise to assess your technical skills in action.
3. Production-Ready Preparation (40 minutes): This phase presents a real-world scenario to finalize and prepare the work for production deployment.

You can find more details in the respective readme files.

To ensure a smooth and focused process, each stage is separated by a 10-minute break.
