# Case Study: Transaction Pattern Recognition

## Background
Understanding spending behaviors is crucial for improving financial health. By recognizing patterns in transaction data, financial institutions can help users optimize their spending, identify unnecessary expenses, and plan better for the future.

## Data Overview
The system maintains a transaction database, where each transaction is recorded with the following attributes:

- **Booking Date** – The date when the transaction was processed.
- **User** – The unique identifier of the customer.
- **Amount** – The transaction amount (positive for income, negative for expenses).
- **Text** – The transaction description, often containing merchant details.
- **Category** – The classification of the transaction (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment).
- **Partner** – The business or entity involved in the transaction (e.g., employer, retailer, service provider).

## Business Requirement
The goal is to recognize patterns in user transactions to gain insights into financial behavior and support financial well-being. Patterns may be based on:

- **Regularity** – Identifying recurring transactions, such as rent payments, utility bills, or salary deposits.
- **Repetition** – Detecting frequent transactions of similar amounts and categories (e.g., daily coffee purchases, weekly grocery shopping).
- **Partner-Based Trends** – Understanding customer relationships with businesses (e.g., repeated spending at a particular supermarket or subscription-based services).

## Problem to discuss
- Identify and define potential machine learning tasks that can be modeled based on the available transaction data
- Explain what constitutes a feature and a target variable, what information can be extracted, and how these elements contribute to solving the business problem.
- Outline necessary data transformation steps, including preprocessing techniques to clean, structure, and prepare the data for modeling.
- Propose additional feature engineering strategies to improve model performance, such as derived attributes (e.g., transaction frequency, category-based spending patterns).
- Address potential data challenges, such as missing values, inconsistent transaction descriptions, or class imbalance, and suggest approaches to mitigate these issues.
