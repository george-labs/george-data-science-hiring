# Task 3: Adding a feature to the model

## Description

In this iteration, you will enhance the model by adding a new feature. The goal is to introduce a meaningful feature that improves predictions beyond the simple average model.

### What you need to do:

- **Define a new feature** – Identify and implement a feature that could improve rent predictions.
- **Update the model** – Modify the existing linear regression model to include this feature.
- **Train and evaluate** – Fit the updated model and compare its performance to previous versions using appropriate metrics.
- **Ensure applicability** – Make sure the feature can be used consistently in both development and production environments.

This step tests your ability to introduce, implement, and validate features while ensuring consistency across different environments.
