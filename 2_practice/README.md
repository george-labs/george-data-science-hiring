# Data Scientist - Coding Challenge

Welcome to our coding challenge! This challenge evaluates your ability to develop machine learning models in a practical setting. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on the process, expectations, and next steps.

## Collaboration Sessions

You will collaborate with George Financial Health team members to solve a data science task. The collaboration involves two remote pair-programming sessions:
- **First session:** You will work with a Data Scientist.
- **Second session:** A Back End Developer will join you.

**Important Notes:**

In the Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions you need to share your screen so that we can follow your progress.
In case you have a dual monitor setup, please make sure that you also share your browser window.
Of course, you can use the web to research in case you need to look up something.
You are also allowed to use AI powered tools (e.g. ChatGPT) as an extension to refine your *own* 
solution.
Please note, you are not allowed to try to search/ask for exact solutions for the described requirements.
In general, it should feel as if you would have a regular day at work.

## Coding Challenge Overview

### Exercise: From Expert Knowledge to Data-Driven Rent Prediction

You are given an expert-based machine learning model that predicts rent values.

   - Iteration 1: Evaluate Performance of Expert-Based (or Baseline) Model
   Analyze and evaluate the provided expert-based machine learning model that predicts rent values.

   - Iteration 2: Develop Average-Based Model
   Replace the base model with a simple regressor that predicts the mean rent and evaluate their performance. 

   - Iteration 3: Add New Feature
   Introduce an additional feature to the average-based model to improve its performance.

   - Iteration 4: Prepare for PROD
   Prepare the final model for production deployment.

Please always look only at one iteration at a time. 
The goal is to come up with a design which makes future changes to your code base as easy as possible. 
Of course, you shouldn't over-engineer your solution but only design as much as needed.
This is exactly what we are going to evaluate.

### Assumptions
In case the requirements are ambiguous, please write down your assumptions into the project's docs/assumptions.md file. 
Please always create a section for each iteration and put your assumptions under this section. 
This helps us to follow certain design decisions in your code which you came up with based on your assumptions. 
If you need to explain design decisions that don't make any assumptions about the program requirements, don't hesitate to use comments in your source code.


## Evaluation
We will only evaluate your finished iterations. Please make sure that

- Your code is readable.
- The requirements are met.
- The code is in a state that you are happy with.
- You can see these rules as the definition of done for an iteration.

This example might seem a bit hypothetical, yet we believe it's both small and complicated enough.
In case we think your solution and way of working fits ours we will invite your for the final team matching.
If we do not continue the recruiting process with you, we will send you a detailed feedback of our evaluation.

## Requirements

Please use python with standard libraries as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.

### Let's Get Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a branch from `main` named `<firstname>_<lastname>`.
3. Push the new branch to the repository.
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
5. Read the requirements from the _iterations_ section.  
   Please only read one iteration at a time, starting with iteration 1.
6. Please think about how you will approach this problem in code for a few minutes before you start coding.
